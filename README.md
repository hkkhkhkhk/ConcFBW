# ConcFBW
## A Stability Augmentation and Autonomous Landing Plugin for Concorde
### June 2022 - Jan 2023

This all started when I had a deep interest in control theory, and would like to create a stablisation plugin for the Concorde in the X-Plane 11 Flight Simulator, which was created by developer Colimata.

It introduces a fly-by-wire control onto the flight control architecture, all pilot inputs are post-proccessed before sending onto the control surfaces.

The automatic landing module is an extra experiment on the reliability and stability of my control network, which was tested in extreme conditions with videos below.

It is purely an test in my knowledgebase in cascade control loops, and do not serve any purpose in real life.

Enjoy the description below.
